      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> My name is Liban (don't be afraid to ask how to pronounce it haha) and I am currently studying coding and post-bootcamp I aim to jump into the tech field. Outside of the boring school stuff -- I am a big sports guy and also watch anime and a 11/10 chess player (doors always open to some friendly competition). Hopefully by the time I am done with the course I won't need to follow along with a video to make a website! Hope everyone has a good 2022! ...</p>
